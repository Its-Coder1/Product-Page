# 🪑 Modern Chair Color Selector – Product Page

A visually rich, interactive front-end **product page** for a modern chair, built using only **HTML and CSS**.  
This project lets users switch between different chair colors, view animated transitions, and explore product details — all without using JavaScript.

> ⚠️ Note: This page is **partially responsive** — it works best on desktop or laptop screens. Mobile and tablet support is limited but can be improved with additional media queries.
